  <h3>Learn Bulgarian the fun way.</h3>
</div>

## 📖 Description

**HAIDE_Learner** is an educational, gamified app designed to make learning Bulgarian accessible and engaging. Currently, the app offers a structured **Learning Path** to master the Bulgarian alphabet, featuring interactive flashcards with audio pronunciation, quizzes to test your knowledge, and a progress tracking system.

**The Personal Touch:** I created this application because resources for learning Bulgarian are scarce, and I personally need a way to learn the language in an easy, playful manner to communicate with my girlfriend's Bulgarian family! :))

## ✨ Key Features

Here are the key functionalities currently implemented and planned for the future:

*   **Cyrillic Support:** A dedicated focus on mastering the Bulgarian alphabet with flashcards and audio aids.
*   **Interactive Lessons:** Engage with quizzes, matching games, and phrase reordering exercises.
*   **Gamification (Planned):** Earn XP, level up, and maintain your daily "streak" to stay motivated.
*   **Guide Character:** A friendly green goat companion accompanies you on your learning journey!
*   **Offline Mode (Planned):** Download lessons to study without an internet connection.
*   **Progress Tracking:** Visual progress bars for each lesson and saved progress across sessions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

*   **Frontend:** Flutter (Dart)
*   **Backend:** Firebase (Firestore for data storage)
